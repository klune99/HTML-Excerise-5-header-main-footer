        <h2>All About Viburnums</h2>
        
        <p>Viburnums have long been one of the most popular flowering landscape shrubs. There are over 150 species of Viburnum. You can find a variety to suit any garden need: wet or dry, sun or shade, natural or formal, shrub or tree, native or exotic, <abbr title="United States Department of Agriculture">USDA</abbr> Zones 2-9. Bloom times span early spring through June and are followed by attractive fruit and outstanding fall foliage.</p>
        
        <p>Viburnums are well behaved members of the honeysuckle family. They are either shrubs or trees. The tree forms may require some pruning to achieve the desired shape. The <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> National Arboretum has done extensive breeding for hardy, pest resistant varieties.</p>
        
        <p>Viburnums work great as hedges or in mass groupings and also make interesting specimen plants or anchors in borders.</p>
        
        <p>Most viburnums prefer full sun but will adjust to partial shade. They like a moderately fertile soil with a <abbr title="potential of Hydrogen">pH</abbr> between 5.6 - 6.6., although many do just fine in alkaline soils. In general, viburnums are not terrible particular about where they grow.</p>
        
        <p>That few pests will bother viburnums is one of the reasons they have become so popular in the landscape. Recently the Viburnum Leaf Beetle (<abbr title="Viburnum Leaf Beetle">VLB</abbr>) has been introduced into North America trough Canada and has begun making its way south.</p>
